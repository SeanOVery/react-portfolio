      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am an aspiring web developer currently living in Kennesaw, Georgia. I started out working in IT 10 years ago focusing mostly on computer hardware. Computer hardware is still where most of my experience lies but I've had a side interest in software the whole time. I'm now developing those skills and looking to potentially build a career in software.
      </p>
      <p>
      Beyond technology I've worked in a variety of fields. Some tech adjacent for example running a project to digitize a companies old files. Some not, like working in winemaking for a few wineries.
      </p>

      Outside of work I'm an avid sports fan. Mostly a soccer fan but I grew up in Boise, Idaho and am a big Boise State football fan. I follow esports as well with my favorite game being Rocket League.
